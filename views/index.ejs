<!--
The code you provided is an EJS (Embedded JavaScript) template code. It includes partials for the header and footer and displays a login and signup buttons in a row.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

ejs

<%- include('partials/header') -%>

This line includes the contents of the partials/header.ejs file. The - character after the opening tag (<%-) and before the closing tag (-%>) removes any whitespace that may be generated during the inclusion.

ejs

<main class="container">
    <div class="row justify-content-around mt-5">
        <a href="/login" class="col-3 btn btn-primary"> Login</a>
        <a href="/signup" class="col-3 btn btn-primary"> Signup</a>
    </div>
</main>

This section represents the main content of the page. It uses Bootstrap classes to create a responsive layout with a container. Inside the container, there is a row with justify-content-around class, which centers the buttons horizontally and adds spacing between them. The buttons are created using anchor tags (<a>) with the respective URLs for login and signup. They have the classes col-3 (occupying 3 columns in the row), btn (button styling), and btn-primary (primary button color).

ejs

<%- include('partials/footer') -%>

This line includes the contents of the partials/footer.ejs file, similar to the header inclusion.

Overall, this code structure allows you to reuse the header and footer across multiple pages and display login and signup buttons in a responsive row.
